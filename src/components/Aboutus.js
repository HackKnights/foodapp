        <p> This website is a tool made for local Chinese restaurants. In
        traditional ways of ordering food, the wait time can be long and
        inconvenient. Additionally, some customers have specific preferences
        about their food, making customization essential for restaurants to
        deliver the perfect dish. Our website addresses these challenges by
        reducing wait times and enabling customization, ensuring customer
        satisfaction.</p>
